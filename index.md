## HackerOne:

I have a public HackerOne security vulnerability disclosure program for my website. If you would like to search for vulnerabilities or report one, please view the program here: [https://hackerone.com/jamieweb](https://hackerone.com/jamieweb)

Valid submissions will be thanked publicly on my HackerOne program page.

**Please note that my HackerOne program does not provide bounties/rewards as JamieWeb is only a small personal project.**

Thank you!
